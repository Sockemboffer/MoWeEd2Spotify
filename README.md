# NPR2Spotify
This program creates one Spotify [Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1tnm7cyegqffdjtsz6mt1ozcl?si=oQepJ6nKTVmZ6rYdRaEDTQ/) for every day's interlude music (*when song information is/was present*) on back through to 1995! It's likely not perfect at matching but, feel free to send playlist corrections to **MoWeEd2Spotify[a-t]pm.me** 🙃

[Morning Edition](https://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/)

[Weekend Edition Saturday](https://www.npr.org/programs/weekend-edition-saturday/)

[Weekend Edition Sunday](https://www.npr.org/programs/weekend-edition-sunday/)

## Problem
Would take a long time (*like, 95ish days non-stop for one person*) to go verify and create playlists for NPR's Morning and Weekend Edition interludes. While this little project took me a year-ish to complete, I was able to learn some more about programming.

One of my first programming projects. Suggestions welcomed. Go easy on me and Enjoy!
