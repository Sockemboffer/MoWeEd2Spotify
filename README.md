# NPR2Spotify
Too much great music between segments that I never have time to dig for on their website.

Playlists for every day's interlude music when song information is/was present back to 1995! 

## Problem
Would take a long time (like, 95ish days non-stop for one person) to go verify and create playlists for NPR's Morning and Weekend Edition interludes. While this little project took me a year-ish to complete, I was able to learn some more about programming.

One of my first programming projects. Suggestions welcomed. Go easy on me and Enjoy!
