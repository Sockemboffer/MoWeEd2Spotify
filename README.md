# NPR2Spotify
Too much great music between segments that I never have time to dig for on their website. So I used this as a good time to learn some more about programming and automated [Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1tnm7cyegqffdjtsz6mt1ozcl?si=oQepJ6nKTVmZ6rYdRaEDTQ/) creation for every day's interlude music when song information is/was present back to 1995! It's likely not perfect at matching but, feel free to send playlist corrections to MoWeEd2Spotify[a-t]pm.me ðŸ™ƒ

[Weekend Edition Saturday](https://www.npr.org/programs/weekend-edition-saturday/)

[Weekend Edition Sunday](https://www.npr.org/programs/weekend-edition-sunday/)

## Problem
Would take a long time (like, 95ish days non-stop for one person) to go verify and create playlists for NPR's Morning and Weekend Edition interludes. While this little project took me a year-ish to complete, I was able to learn some more about programming.

One of my first programming projects. Suggestions welcomed. Go easy on me and Enjoy!
